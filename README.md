A CoD4 deathrun map for [Deathrun 1.2 Mod by BraXi](https://github.com/BraXi/CoD4_DeathRun_1.2_Mod)

I created this map because I love playing Deathrun on Modern Warefare, and because I was mostly bored and had nothing else to do. It took me 3 weeks to complete this project and learn how to map and script for CoD4.

### Features
- Custom music menu (5 songs, changeable)
- Unique secret that doesn't skip the whole map
- 8 activator traps
- 2 passive traps
- 11 End choices
  - Sniper room
  - Weapon room
  - Knife room
  - RPG room
  - Pistol room
  - Grenade room
  - Flashbang room
  - Simon says room
  - Bounce room
  - Old (1vs1)
  - Old (Jumpers vs Activator) (Requires freerun)
- Each end choice has multiple spawns (less chance of getting spawn killed if you fall)
- Anti-camp teleport if activator camps in spawn
- Map uses portals (better fps on lower end computers)
- Custom weapons & models
- Plugin support for the "Wait your turn" / turn respect
- Map checkpoint minigame to slow down gameplay and allow the activator to keep up
- Non-intrusive map credit messages
- Non-intrusive map creator only features (I made a button for myself so i can get all the secret weapons at spawn)
- No VIP only content
